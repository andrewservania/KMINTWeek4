Tasks for 29th of September
- Move the rabbit's state choice mechanism to the StateMachine class if it's possible. (More Logical) - RESULT, code has not been moved to the StateMachine class
  due to the fact that the StateMachine class is a template class and both the cow and rabbit use the class to instantiate the StateMachine class.
  Moving the decision-making code for the rabbit in the StateMachine class would be mean that code would be available both for the cow and the rabbit
  which is not what is wanted.
- Add proper comments to the application DONE
